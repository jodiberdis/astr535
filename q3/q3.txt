What is the solar constant (definition and value, look it up if necessary)?
The solar constant is the Sun's average output radiation (or flux) at 1 AU, across all wavelengths. The generally accepted value is 1.361 kW/m^2.


 What is the surface brightness of the Sun as seen from Earth? 
Surface Brightness = Flux(solar constant) / Solid Angle
Solid Angle = pi*R^2 / d^2
SB = Flux*d^2 / pi*R^2 = 20043.6 kW/m^2



What would the solar constant and surface brightness of the Sun be as seen from Jupiter?
Flux(Jupiter) = (d(Earth)^2 / d(Jupiter)^2) * Flux(Earth) = 1.085E-6 kW/m^2 would be the solar constant at Jupiter.
Surface Brightness = Flux(solar constant) / Solid Angle
Solid Angle = pi*R^2 / d^2
SB = Flux*d^2 / pi*R^2 = 19956.2 kW/m^2
