# Imagine you are observing a binary star system, but where the stars are so close together 
# that you cannot resolve them, and you see them as a single object. 
# If the two stars have magnitudes of 17 and 18 individually, what is the combined 
# observed magnitude? 
# Write a (short!) software function that takes as input the apparent magnitude of each of 
# two stars, and computes and returns the apparent magnitude of the two stars combined.
