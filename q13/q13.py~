# Start to develop a software module that will use the count equation that will eventually be used 
# for an exposure time calculator. The module should include individual functions that return values 
# for each of the terms on the count equation: photon flux, telescope area, atmospheric transmission, 
# system transmission (split into separate routines for each of telescope throughput, instrument 
# throughput, filter throughput, and detector efficiency). Each routine should accept as input a 
# wavelength or array of wavelengths, and return values at all of the specified input wavelengths. 
# A higher level function should return the estimated counts integrated over all wavelengths; 
# for the initial effort you could just return a constant value at all wavelengths, but look forward 
# to building in the capability for wavelength dependence, e.g., interpolating from a list of 
# wavelength/values from an input file. A higher level function should return the estimated counts 
# integrated over all wavelengths. You should make appropriate use of input keywords and default values. 
# You are strongly encouraged to sketch out the design of the program before starting to write it, 
# considering the eventual use of the program to provide exposure time estimates for all of the APO 3.5m 
# instruments (and perhaps others), where you will have wavelength dependent throughputs for multiple 
# components. Test the program by using it to do the calculation for the NMSU 1m. 
# *********************************************************************************************************
# Continue working on your exposure time calculator software by adding routines to calculate the S/N 
# of a given exposure. You will want to call your count equation routine to get the signal for an object 
# of some input magnitude, call it again to get the background for a given sky brightness, allow for an 
# input sky area/image size (with suitable default value), and call a routine to return the readout noise 
# for an input pixel scale and input sky area/image size. Validate your routine using the results from 
# the previous question.
