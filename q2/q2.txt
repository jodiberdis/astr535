1) There are 8 NMSU programs this quarter. Nancy's Jupiter atmosphere, our ASTR535 class visit, Nancy's transneptunian objects, Carlos' H-alpha galaxies, two visits for Dmitry's superthin galaxies, Kaike's LEGUE pipeline stellar parameter, and Karen's variable stars.

2) These images show cloud cover above 2.5m and 3.5m. Brightness indicates warmth, or cloud features above the telescopes. Allows for the tracking of clouds across the sky throughout the night.

3) Looked through instruments of telescopes. One question I have is how a spectrum taken from and echelle spectrograph looks different than a standard one, such as on SDSS. Also curious how the science taken from FlareCam and SurveyCam of the 0.5m differ? Benefits of using one or the other?

4) Submitted housing request!
